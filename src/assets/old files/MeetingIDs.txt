//Learning how to create APIs
<!--Methods used with api's-->
GET-> READ
POST-> CREATE
PATCH -> UPDATE
DELETE -> DESTROY

HEAD -> asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body
PUT -> this method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload
CONNECT -> establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target
OPTIONS -> is used to describe the communication options for the target resource
TRACE -> performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource
PATCH -> this method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource

<!--steps for creating apis-->
1. start a new project: npm init -y (this will create a package json and gives us context for installing packages we can use in node such as expressjs)
2. Now install express: npm install express( from here we need a file to write our code in  preferebly: index.js file)
3. now, at the top of the file(inside) declare a vaiable for app which represents the actual API that we are builiding, 
type: const app = require('express')();
      const PORT = 8080;
      app.listen(
        PORT,
        () => console.log(`it's alive on http://localhost: ${PORT}`)
        
        )
<!--now (run: node .) to start the server-->
